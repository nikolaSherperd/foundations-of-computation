# Foundations of Computation
The acquisition of deep technical mastery in the moden era suffers from a fundamental fragmentation. Traditional computer science curricula ofen divorce theory from practice, while the bootcamp-styled accelerated learning frequently produces "abstraction-independent" developers—practitioners who can manipulate high level APIs but lack the foundational reasoning to troubleshoot systems at the hardware and mathematical level.


This repository documents my effort to rebuild mathematical and computational foundations from first principles.

Rather than relying on high-level libraries, I focus on implementing and visualizing core ideas directly in Python, C/C++. The goal is conceptual clarity, not performance.

## Contents

### Tier 0: Foundations of Technical Mastery (The Bedrock)
Total Duration: 9-12 months

Prerequisites: None

Objective: Eliminate abstaction dependency. Achieve mathematical fluency and low-level
memory mastery

### Boolean Logic
Scripts that generate truth tables for complex Boolean expressions. These were written to better understand how symbolic logic maps to computation.

### Linear Algebra
Basic vector operations and linear transformations implemented explicitly to reinforce geometric intuition.

### Visualization
Manim scenes used to visualize vectors, transformations, and coordinate changes. Visualization is used as a thinking tool to expose misunderstandings.

## Motivation
I believe strong research work depends on deep understanding of fundamentals. This repository reflects an intentional effort to build that understanding through implementation and visualization.
